# Minecraft plugin
In 9th grade, during the summer of 2020, when we were all stuck in home, I took a Udemy course on Minecraft plugins (linked below). Using the knowledge from this course, I decided to make my own simple plugin.

The plugin allows users to save specific locations in their Minecraft worlds with any name they wish to keep. Later, they can use custom minecraft commands to teleport to locations saved earlier.
